# BabysFirstPrisonBreak
My submission for my CPSC 1060 RPG project, Assignment 2. Hope you guys like it!

This is my attempt at a basic dungeon crawl type game, the main character is a prisoner trying to escape the dungeon.
There are different usable weapons, a character inventory, combat, puzzles, and several enemies scattered across the map. 
The player uses selective verbs and nouns to create actions that interact with the environment.
Have fun, and don't try too hard to break the game.
